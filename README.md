# Share Coupons Webapp

_Still under development_

## Overview

Share-Coupons is a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. The app is designed to address the common issue of unused or unwanted coupons shared by companies or apps, which might not be useful to the original recipient but could benefit other users.

## Problem Statement

Many companies and apps distribute coupons to their users as part of promotional activities. However, users often receive coupons for products or services they may not be interested in, leading to a wastage of valuable discounts. Additionally, these unused coupons go to waste while other users who would have benefited from them miss out on potential savings.

## Solution

Share-Coupons aims to tackle this problem by creating a community-driven platform where users can share their unwanted coupons with others who might find them useful. The app allows registered users to post details of coupons they wish to share and browse through a variety of coupons shared by other users. Users can also search for specific coupons based on categories, products, or services they are interested in.
